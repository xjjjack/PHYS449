# PHYS449

## Dependencies

- json
- argparse
- matplotlib
- numpy
- torch
- pathlib

## Running `main.py`

To run `main.py`, use

```sh
python main.py -o result_dir -n 100 --param inputs\param.json
```

## Note
All arguments are optional. Values in above are already set as default value. So it's equivalent to:

```sh
python main.py
```

It will also output a pdf file including the loss figure in the output dir

To enable verbose mode, it can be run as

```sh
python main.py --verbose
```

Content in the folder 'result_dir' is generated by a sample run with epoch=500 and n=200.

===GITHUB SETUP===

Create a *private* github (Github.com) repository named PHYS449. Follow the
instructions on https://github.com/yhteoh/PHYS-449-Assignment-Template to learn
more about basics of Github and for the template to follow. Invite me and my TA
Ejaaz Merali to your private repository using our github IDs:

github id: emerali
github id: pooya-git

IMPORTANT: For all assignments, the last commit to the main branch before the
deadline is used to assess the assignment. (Github's timestamp is a strict
deadline for acceptance of your work).


===PROBLEM STATEMENT===

In this assignment you implement a simple linear regression model (feature map
is just identity here) using both the analytic solution and using gradient
descent.

Deadline: End of day (Midnight) Eastern Time Zone Friday Sep 23, 2022

Input file name is of the format *.in
Output file name is of the format *.out
Json file name is of the format *.json

The command to run your code should be of the format

python main.py data/file_name.in data/file_name.json

Therefore main.py from your implementation receives two arguments (two file names)
and writes in a third file (not provided as an argument).

file_name is an identical name for both the input file (*.in) and the json file
(*.json). The json file is a dictionary of two hyperparameters (learning rate
and number of iterations of gradient descent). The output file also should have
the same name but appended with a .out extension.


==Example input file==

The input file will have arbitrary number of lines. All lines are of the format

x_1 x_2 ... x_M y

having same number of space delimited real numbers on them. In the provided
example data/1.in the file contains the lines

----------1.in---------
14 20 69
16 3 -1
24 30 99
11 62 240
30 -4 -43
----------EOF----------

which should be interpreted as a training dataset of 5 samples (x, y) where x is
a two-dimensional real vector x = (x1, x2). Therefore each line of 1.in is of
the format:

x1 x2 y


==Example output file==

In the same example you are expected to create an output file with the same path
and the same file name but with a .out extension (data/1.out) with an example
content:

---------1.out---------
3.0000
-1.0000
4.0000

0.7180
-0.9106
4.0208
----------EOF----------

reporting two sets of numbers separated with an empty line in between and each
vector delimited by newline. Each number is printed in the file with 4 decimal
places. Therefore this file is of the format:

w_analytic1
w_analytic2
w_analytic3

w_gd1
w_gd2
w_gd3

The first vector (w_analytic) is the analytic solution to the least square
regression and the second (w_gd) is the returned solution from gradient descent
with learning rate and number of iterations determined in the corresponding json
file.


==Example json file==

The json file is a python dictionary with choices of the above-mentioned
hyperparameters. Depending on your implementation, good choice of
hyperparameters might be different from these example values. By trial and
error modify these values so that your gradient descent produces results as
close as possible to the analytic solutions.

---------1.json---------
{
	"learning rate": 0.0001,
	"num iter": 1000
}
-----------EOF----------
